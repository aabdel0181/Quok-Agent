          "text": "<thinking>\nTo run a complete GPU benchmark cycle, we will need to use several tools in the following order:\n\n1. get_available_gpus - This will give us the list of available GPUs to choose from. No parameters needed.\n\n2. rent_compute - Once we have the list of GPUs, we can select the best one and rent it. This requires the cluster_name, node_name, and gpu_count parameters. We can get the cluster_name and node_name from the output of get_available_gpus. For gpu_count, we can just request 1 GPU.\n\n3. get_gpu_status - After requesting the rental, we need to check the status to see when it's ready. No parameters needed. We'll need to call this repeatedly until the status is no longer \"starting\".\n\n4. ssh_connect - Once the GPU instance is ready, we can connect to it via SSH. This requires the host, username, and private_key_path parameters. We can get the host from the get_gpu_status output. For username, we can use \"ubuntu\". For private_key_path, we can use the default SSH_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH environment variable.\n\n5. remote_shell - With the SSH connection established, we can run shell commands to set up the environment, run benchmarks, etc. The only parameter is the shell command to run. We'll need to run multiple commands:\n   - Install dependencies like nvidia-smi, cuda, etc \n   - Run nvidia-smi to verify GPU\n   - Run a benchmark like GPUTest and capture results\n   - Clean up \n\n6. terminate_compute - After the benchmark is done, we should terminate the GPU instance to avoid extra charges. This requires the instance_id parameter which we can get from the get_gpu_status output.\n\nThe user has not provided values for any of the required parameters, but we can infer most of them by chaining the tool calls in the right order. The only thing we may need to prompt for is selecting which GPU to use if there are multiple good options.\n</thinking>",
