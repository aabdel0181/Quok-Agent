If not, we need to rent one.\n2. GetAvailableGPUs - If no instance running, get list of available GPUs to select one at random to rent. \n3. RentCompute - Rent the randomly selected GPU.\n4. SSHConnect - Connect to the rented GPU instance via SSH.\n5. RemoteShell - Run commands to set up environment and dependencies on the GPU instance.\n6. GPUHealthCheck - Run the GPU health check. This tool handles the repository management.\n7. DynamoDBInsert - Store the health check results in DynamoDB. This step is critical.\n8. CUBLASBenchmark - Run the CUBLAS benchmarking tests. \n9. RemoteShell - Clean up resources on the instance when done.\n10. TerminateCompute - Terminate the GPU instance after benchmarking is complete.\n\nThe user has provided all the high-level steps, so we have enough information to proceed with the tool calls in the specified order.\n</thinking>",
