No parameters needed.\n\n2. If no instance running:\n   a. GetAvailableGpus - Get list of available GPUs. No parameters needed. \n   b. RentCompute - Rent the cheapest GPU. Will need cluster_name, node_name from GetAvailableGpus output, and gpu_count which we can set to 1.\n\n3. SSHConnect - Connect to the rented GPU instance. Will need host, username, password/private_key_path from the RentCompute output. \n\n4. GPUHealthCheck - Set up environment and check GPU health. Needs data_store parameter which we can provide.\n\n5. RemoteShell - Run performance tests by executing commands on the remote instance. Needs command parameter which we will provide based on the tests to run.\n\n6. TerminateCompute - Clean up the instance when done. Needs the instance_id from RentCompute output.\n\nWe have all the necessary parameters to proceed with the tool calls in this order. Long-running commands can be split into smaller ones and progress checked via RemoteShell.\n</thinking>",
