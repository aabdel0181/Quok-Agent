If no active instance:\n   a. get_available_gpus - Get a list of available GPUs to rent\n   b. rent_compute - Randomly select a GPU from the list and rent it\n\n3. ssh_connect - Connect to the rented GPU instance via SSH \n\n4. remote_shell - Use this to set up the environment on the GPU instance:\n   - Check if the benchmark repo is cloned, if not clone it\n   - Install any required dependencies\n   - Navigate to the scripts directory and make the gpu_health.sh script executable\n\n5. gpu_health_check - Run the GPU health check script and store the results locally\n\n6. dynamodb_insert - Insert the health check results into the GPUHealthChecks DynamoDB table\n\n7. remote_shell - Run the actual benchmarking tests (ignore details for now)\n\n8. terminate_compute - Clean up by terminating the GPU instance when done\n\nThe user has provided all the high-level steps, so we have enough information to proceed with the tool calls in the order outlined above.
