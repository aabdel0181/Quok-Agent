First, we should check if we already have a GPU instance running using the get_gpu_status tool. This does not require any parameters.\n\n2. If no GPU is currently running, we need to:\n   a. Get a list of available GPUs using the get_available_gpus tool (no parameters needed)\n   b. Select the cheapest GPU from the list \n   c. Rent the selected GPU using the rent_compute tool, providing the cluster_name, node_name, and gpu_count as parameters. We can get the cluster_name and node_name from the output of get_available_gpus, and set gpu_count to 1 to get the cheapest single GPU.\n\n3. Once we have a running GPU instance, we need to connect to it via SSH using the ssh_connect tool. This requires the host, username, and optionally password or private_key_path. We can get the required host and username from the output of the get_gpu_status tool after renting the GPU.\n\n4. After connecting via SSH, we can run the gpu_health_check tool to check the GPU health and install dependencies. This tool will automatically store the health check results using the dynamodb_insert tool.\n\n5. The actual benchmarking tests will be ignored for now as per the instructions.\n\n6. Finally, once everything is done, we can clean up the GPU instance using the terminate_compute tool, providing the instance_id that we can get from the get_gpu_status output.\n\nThe results will be returned in JSON format at the end. For long running operations like installations, the commands will be split into smaller parts to check progress.\n</thinking>",
