If so, we can use that for the benchmark. If not, we need to rent one.\n\n2. If no active instance:\n   a. GetAvailableGPUs - Get a list of available GPUs and their prices \n   b. RentCompute - Rent the cheapest available GPU\n\n3. SSHConnect - Connect to the rented GPU instance via SSH to set up environment and run tests\n\n4. RemoteShell - Run commands on the GPU instance to:\n   a. Check if required dependencies are installed, if not install them\n   b. Run the GPU health check\n   c. Run the benchmarking tests\n   d. Retrieve the test results\n\n5. TerminateCompute - Clean up by terminating the GPU instance when done\n\n6. DynamoDBInsert - Store the benchmark results in DynamoDB\n\nThe user has provided all the high-level steps, but we will need to fill in some of the details like which specific GPU to rent, the dependency installation commands, health check and benchmark commands etc by calling the tools.\n</thinking>",

Without a GPU instance, I won't be able to proceed with the benchmarking. \n\nHere is what I suggest as next steps:\n\n1. Check back later to see if any GPU instances become available to rent using the GetAvailableGPUs tool. \n\n2. Once a GPU is available, rent it using the RentCompute tool, specifying the cheapest instance.\n\n3. Connect to the rented instance via SSH using the SSHConnect tool.\n\n4. Install any required dependencies and run the health check + benchmarks using the RemoteShell tool.\n\n5. Retrieve the benchmark results, terminate the instance using TerminateCompute, and store the results in DynamoDB using DynamoDBInsert.\n\nUnfortunately I cannot complete the full benchmarking cycle at this time without an available GPU instance. Please try again later when compute resources become available. Let me know if you need any other assistance!",
