          "text": "<thinking>\nTo run a complete GPU benchmark cycle, we will need to use several tools in the correct order:\n\n1. First, we should check if we already have a GPU instance running using the get_gpu_status tool. This does not require any parameters.\n\n2. If no GPU is currently running, we need to:\n   a. Get a list of available GPUs using the get_available_gpus tool (no parameters needed)\n   b. Select the cheapest GPU from the list \n   c. Rent the selected GPU using the rent_compute tool, providing the cluster_name, node_name, and gpu_count as parameters. We can get the cluster_name and node_name from the output of get_available_gpus, and set gpu_count to 1 to get the cheapest single GPU.\n\n3. Once we have a running GPU instance, we need to connect to it via SSH using the ssh_connect tool. This requires the host, username, and optionally password or private_key_path. We can get the host from the output of get_gpu_status.\n\n4. After connecting via SSH:\n   a. We should set up the environment and install dependencies using the remote_shell tool to run the necessary commands. We may need to run multiple commands to complete the setup.\n   b. Run the gpu_health_check tool to check the GPU health. This will automatically store the results using dynamodb_insert.\n\n5. The instructions say to ignore running the actual benchmarking tests for now.\n\n6. Finally, once everything is complete, we should terminate the GPU instance using the terminate_compute tool, providing the instance_id that we can get from the output of get_gpu_status.\n\nThe main missing piece of information is the username to use for the ssh_connect tool. Let's ask the user to provide that.\n</thinking>",
