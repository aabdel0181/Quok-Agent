No parameters needed.\n\n2. If no instance running:\n   a. GetAvailableGPUs - Get list of available GPUs. No parameters needed. \n   b. RentCompute - Rent the cheapest GPU. Will need cluster_name, node_name from GetAvailableGPUs output, and gpu_count which we can set to 1.\n\n3. SSHConnect - Connect to the rented GPU instance. Will need host, username, password/private_key_path from the RentCompute output. \n\n4. gpu_health_check - Check GPU health and set up environment. Will store results in a file.\n\n5. RemoteShell - Run benchmark commands on the instance. Will split into smaller commands and check progress. The exact benchmark commands are not provided, so we'll have to ask the user for those.\n\n6. TerminateCompute - Clean up the instance when done. Will need the instance_id from RentCompute output.\n\nThe user did not provide the specific benchmark tests to run, so we will need to ask for those details. We have all other information needed to proceed with the tool calls.\n</thinking>",

The Hyperbolic platform to have GPUs available to rent \n2. The specific benchmark tests you would like me to run on the GPU instance\n\nPlease let me know once GPUs are available to rent again, and provide the benchmark test details. I'll be happy to run the full cycle for you then.\n\nIn the meantime, let me know if there are any other questions I can assist with!",
