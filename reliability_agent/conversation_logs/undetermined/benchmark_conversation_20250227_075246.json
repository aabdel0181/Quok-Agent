First, we should check if we already have a GPU instance running using the get_gpu_status tool. This does not require any parameters.\n\n2. If no GPU is currently running, we need to:\n   a. Get a list of available GPUs using the get_available_gpus tool (no parameters needed)\n   b. Select the cheapest GPU from the list \n   c. Rent the selected GPU using the rent_compute tool, providing the cluster_name, node_name, and gpu_count as parameters. We can get the cluster_name and node_name from the output of get_available_gpus, and set gpu_count to 1 to get the cheapest single GPU.\n\n3. Once we have a running GPU instance, we need to connect to it via SSH using the ssh_connect tool. This requires the host, username, and optionally password or private_key_path. We can get the required host and username from the output of the get_gpu_status tool after renting the GPU.\n\n4. After connecting via SSH:\n   a. We should run the gpu_health_check tool to check the GPU health and install dependencies. This will automatically store the health check results using dynamodb_insert.\n   b. We can skip the actual benchmarking tests for now as indicated.\n\n5. Finally, once everything is done, we should terminate the GPU instance using the terminate_compute tool, providing the instance_id that we can get from the get_gpu_status output.\n\nThe key is to call the tools in the right order and pass the outputs from one tool as inputs to the next. We have all the required parameters except the actual benchmarking commands which can be skipped for now.\n</thinking>",
