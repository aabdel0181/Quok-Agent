First, we should check if we already have a GPU instance running using the get_gpu_status tool. This does not require any parameters.\n\n2. If no GPU is currently running, we need to:\n   a. Get a list of available GPUs using the get_available_gpus tool (no parameters needed)\n   b. Select the cheapest GPU from the list \n   c. Rent the selected GPU using the rent_compute tool. This requires the cluster_name, node_name, and gpu_count parameters. We can get the cluster_name and node_name from the output of get_available_gpus, and set gpu_count to 1 to get the cheapest option.\n\n3. Once we have a running GPU instance, we need to connect to it via SSH using the ssh_connect tool. This requires the host, username, and optionally password or private_key_path. We can get the host from the output of get_gpu_status.\n\n4. After connecting, we should run the gpu_health_check tool to check the GPU health and install dependencies. This tool will automatically store the health check results using dynamodb_insert.\n\n5. We can skip the actual benchmarking tests for now as instructed.\n\n6. Finally, when done, we should terminate the GPU instance using the terminate_compute tool, providing the instance_id from get_gpu_status.\n\nThe key is to call the tools in the right order and pass the outputs from one tool as inputs to the next. We have all the required parameters except the SSH username which we will need to ask the user for.\n</thinking>",
