First, we should check if we already have a GPU instance running using the get_gpu_status tool. This does not require any parameters.\n\n2. If no GPU is currently running, we need to:\n   a. Get a list of available GPUs using the get_available_gpus tool (no parameters needed)\n   b. Select the cheapest GPU from the list \n   c. Rent the selected GPU using the rent_compute tool, providing the cluster_name, node_name and gpu_count\n\n3. Once we have a running GPU instance, we need to connect to it via SSH using the ssh_connect tool. This requires:\n   - host: We can get this from the get_gpu_status tool output \n   - username: This should be provided in the get_gpu_status output\n   - private_key_path: We can use the default SSH_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH from the environment\n\n4. After connecting via SSH, we need to:\n   a. Check and install dependencies using remote_shell commands\n   b. Run the gpu_health_check tool to check GPU health and store results in DynamoDB\n      - This will automatically store results in DynamoDB using the dynamodb_insert tool\n   c. Navigate to the benchmarks directory and run the benchmark scripts using remote_shell\n\n5. Finally, once benchmarking is complete, we should terminate the GPU instance using the terminate_compute tool, providing the instance_id from get_gpu_status.\n\nThe key missing piece of information is the gpu_count to use when renting the GPU instance in step 2c. We should ask the user to provide this.\n</thinking>",
