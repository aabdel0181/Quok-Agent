No parameters needed.\n\n2. If no instance running:\n   a. GetAvailableGPUs - Get list of available GPUs. No parameters needed. \n   b. RentCompute - Rent the cheapest GPU. Will need cluster_name, node_name from GetAvailableGPUs output, and gpu_count which we can set to 1.\n\n3. SSHConnect - Connect to the rented GPU instance. Will need host, username, password/private_key_path from the RentCompute output. \n\n4. GPUHealthCheck - Set up environment and check GPU health. Needs data_store parameter which we can provide.\n\n5. RemoteShell - Run benchmark commands on the instance. Will need to split into smaller commands and check progress. The exact commands will come from the GPUHealthCheck repo readme.\n\n6. TerminateCompute - Clean up the instance when done. Will need the instance_id from RentCompute output.\n\nLooks like we have all the tools and info needed to proceed, except the exact benchmark commands which we'll get from the GPUHealthCheck repo. Let's start executing the steps.\n</thinking>",

However, there are currently no GPUs available to rent.\n\nHere are a few options to proceed:\n\n1. Wait a bit and check again later to see if any GPUs become available. You can use the GetAvailableGPUs action periodically to monitor.\n\n2. Add more Hyperbolic credits to your account in case higher-end GPUs become available that cost more. You can purchase credits or deposit cryptocurrency.\n\n3. Consider linking your crypto wallet to your Hyperbolic account, so you can directly use ETH/USDC to rent GPUs without having to manually add credits first. The LinkWalletAddress action can help with that.\n\nLet me know how you'd like to proceed. I'm happy to help with any of those options. We can run the full benchmark cycle once a suitable GPU becomes available to rent. Just let me know if you need anything else in the meantime!",
