First, we should check if we already have a GPU instance running using the get_gpu_status tool. This does not require any parameters.\n\n2. If no GPU is currently running, we need to:\n   a. Get a list of available GPUs using the get_available_gpus tool (no parameters needed)\n   b. Select the cheapest GPU from the list \n   c. Rent the selected GPU using the rent_compute tool, providing the cluster_name, node_name, and gpu_count as parameters. We can get the cluster_name and node_name from the output of get_available_gpus, and set gpu_count to 1 to get the cheapest option.\n\n3. Once we have a running GPU instance, we need to set up the environment:\n   a. Connect to the instance using ssh_connect, providing the host, username, and private_key_path parameters. We can get the host from the output of get_gpu_status.\n   b. Install dependencies by running commands using the remote_shell tool. We will need to split long running installations into multiple smaller commands and check progress.\n\n4. With the environment set up, we can run the gpu_health_check tool to check the GPU health. This will store the results in a local file.\n\n5. We then need to insert the health check data into DynamoDB using the dynamodb_insert tool, providing the data from the health check output file and setting the data_type to 'GPUHealthCheck'.\n\n6. After the health check, we would run the benchmarking tests, but this step can be ignored for now based on the instructions.\n\n7. Finally, once everything is complete, we can terminate the GPU instance using the terminate_compute tool, providing the instance_id that we can get from the output of get_gpu_status.\n\nThe results should be returned in JSON format at the end.\n</thinking>",
