If not, proceed to step 2.\n\n2. GetAvailableGpus - Get a list of available GPUs. We need this to select a random consumer GPU to rent.\n\n3. RentCompute - Rent the selected random consumer GPU. This requires the cluster_name, node_name (from GetAvailableGpus output), and gpu_count (default to 1).\n\n4. SSHConnect - Connect to the rented GPU instance via SSH. Requires the host, username, and optionally password or private key. \n\n5. RemoteShell - Set up the environment and install dependencies on the GPU instance. Run commands to check progress of long-running operations.\n\n6. GPUHealthCheck - Run the GPU health check. This will handle cloning the repo and running the health check script. Stores the output locally and in DynamoDB.\n\n7. RemoteShell - Run the actual benchmarking tests on the instance. (Ignore for now based on instructions).\n\n8. TerminateCompute - Clean up the rented resource when done by terminating the instance.\n\nThe main pieces of information we are missing are:\n- The selected random consumer GPU (cluster_name, node_name) \n- The SSH connection details for the rented instance (host, username, password)\n\nWe can get the GPU selection by calling GetAvailableGpus first. \nThe SSH details should be available after calling RentCompute on the selected GPU.\n\nSo the overall order of tool calls should be:\n1. GetGPUStatus \n2. GetAvailableGpus\n3. RentCompute\n4. GetGPUStatus (to get SSH details)\n5. SSHConnect\n6. RemoteShell (setup)\n7. GPUHealthCheck\n8. RemoteShell (benchmark - ignore for now)\n9. TerminateCompute\n\nLet's proceed with this plan.\n</thinking>",
