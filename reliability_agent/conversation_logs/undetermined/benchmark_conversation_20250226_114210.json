No parameters needed.\n\n2. If no instance running:\n   a. GetAvailableGpus - Get list of available GPUs. No parameters needed. \n   b. RentCompute - Rent the cheapest GPU. Will need cluster_name, node_name from GetAvailableGpus output, and gpu_count from user (default to 1 if not provided).\n\n3. SSHConnect - Connect to the rented GPU instance. Will need host, username, password/private_key_path from RentCompute output. \n\n4. RemoteShell - Run commands to:\n   a. Check GPU health \n   b. Set up environment and install dependencies\n   c. Run performance tests\n   d. Retrieve and format results\n\n5. TerminateCompute - Clean up the GPU instance when done. Will need the instance_id from RentCompute output.\n\nIt looks like we have all the necessary tools and should be able to infer the required parameters from the outputs of previous steps. The only thing we may need to ask the user for is the gpu_count if they want more than 1 GPU. Let's proceed with the tool calls in order.\n</thinking>",
