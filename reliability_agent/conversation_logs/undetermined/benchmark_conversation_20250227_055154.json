RentCompute - Rent the cheapest available GPU\n\n3. SSHConnect - Connect to the rented GPU instance via SSH to set up environment and run tests\n\n4. RemoteShell - Run commands on the GPU instance to:\n   a. Check if required dependencies are installed, if not install them\n   b. Run the GPU health check\n   c. Run the benchmarking tests\n   d. Retrieve the test results\n\n5. TerminateCompute - Clean up by terminating the GPU instance when done\n\n6. DynamoDBInsert - Store the benchmark results in DynamoDB\n\nThe user has not provided the specific GPU to use, so we will infer to use the cheapest available one.\n</thinking>",

Without a GPU instance, I'm unable to proceed with setting up the environment, running health checks and benchmarks, and storing the results\n4. We'll need to wait until GPUs become available on the platform to run the end-to-end benchmark process\n\nI'll keep an eye out and let you know as soon as I see GPUs available to rent so we can kick off the benchmarking.
